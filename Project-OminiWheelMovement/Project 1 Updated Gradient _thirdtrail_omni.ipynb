Introduction\n","Consider a simple formulation of rocket landing where the rocket state $\\textbf{x}(t)$ is represented by its coordinates $x(t)$ and $y(t)$, velocity $\\dot{x}(t)$, $\\dot{y}(t)$, and orientation $\\theta(t)$, i.e., $\\textbf{x}(t) = [x(t), y(t), \\dot{x}(t), \\dot{y}(t), \\theta(t)]^T$, where $t$ specifies time. The control input $\\textbf{u}(t)$ of the rocket includes thrust $a(t)$ and angular velocity $\\omega(t)$. The discrete-time dynamics follows \n","\n","$$\n","\\begin{aligned}\n","& x(t+1) = x(t) + \\dot{x}(t) \\Delta t + 0.5 a(t)\\sin(\\theta(t)) \\Delta t^2, \\\\\n","& y(t+1) = y(t) + \\dot{y}(t) \\Delta t + 0.5 a(t)\\cos(\\theta(t)) \\Delta t^2, \\\\\n","& \\dot{x}(t+1) = \\dot{x}(t) + a(t)\\sin(\\theta(t)) \\Delta t \\\\\n","& \\dot{y}(t+1) = \\dot{y}(t) + a(t)\\cos(\\theta(t)) \\Delta t \\\\\n","& \\theta(t+1) = \\theta(t) + \\omega(t) \\Delta t,\n","& \\end{aligned}\n","$$\n","\n","where $\\Delta t$ is a time interval. Further, let the closed-loop controller be \n","\n","$$\n","\\textbf{u}(t) = [a(t), \\omega(t)] = \\pi_{w}(\\textbf{x}(t))\n","$$\n","\n","where $\\pi_{w}(\\cdot)$ is a neural network with parameters $w$, which are to be determined through optimization.\n","\n","For each time step, we assign a loss as a function of the control input and the state: $l(\\textbf{x}(t),\\textbf{u}(t))$. In this example, we will simply set $l(\\textbf{x}(t),\\textbf{u}(t))=0$ for all $t=1,...,T-1$, where $T$ is the final time step, and $l(\\textbf{x}(T),\\textbf{u}(T)) = ||\\textbf{x}(T)||^2$.\n","\n","The optimization problem is now formulated as\n","\n","$$\n","\\begin{aligned}\n","\\min_{w} \\quad & \\quad ||x(T)||^2 \\\\\n","\\quad & \\quad x(t+1) = x(t) + \\dot{x}(t) \\Delta t + 0.5 a(t)\\sin(\\theta(t)) \\Delta t^2, \\\\\n","\\quad & \\quad y(t+1) = y(t) + \\dot{y}(t) \\Delta t + 0.5 a(t)\\cos(\\theta(t)) \\Delta t^2, \\\\\n","\\quad & \\quad \\dot{x}(t+1) = \\dot{x}(t) + a(t)\\sin(\\theta(t)) \\Delta t \\\\\n","\\quad & \\quad \\dot{y}(t+1) = \\dot{y}(t) + a(t)\\cos(\\theta(t)) \\Delta t \\\\\n","\\quad & \\quad \\theta(t+1) = \\theta(t) + \\omega(t) \\Delta t, \\\\\n","\\quad & \\quad \\text{u}(t) = \\pi_{w}(\\textbf{x}(t)), ~\\forall t=1,...,T-1\n","\\end{aligned}\n","$$\n","\n","While this problem is constrained, it is easy to see that the objective function can be expressed as a function of $\\textbf{x}(T-1)$ and $\\textbf{u}(T-1)$, where $\\textbf{x}(T-1)$ as a function of $\\textbf{x}(T-2)$ and $\\textbf{u}(T-2)$, and so on. Thus it is essentially an unconstrained problem with respect to $w$. \n","\n","In the following, we code the forward pass of the loss using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), which then automatically computes the gradient $\\nabla_{w} l(\\textbf{x}(T),\\textbf{u}(T))$.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 2.

Please document your dynamical system in detail.\n","2. Choose a system with a reasonable amount of state and action variables, so that the problem is nontrivial and solvable.\n","3.
